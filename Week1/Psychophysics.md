Psychophysics is the study of relationship between stimulus and sensation. For example, Contrast sensitivity, Trichromacy.It is used for making more accurate predictions.
According to Web-Fechner law, delta Perception = delta stimulus / stimulus, which is , with a heavier weight , one will need a larger external change to create the same internal change.
The contrast sensitivity function is a measure of the ability to differentiate between different levels of contrast and brightness.
Psychophysics is done using certain experiments."The Detection Task" is used to determine minimum amount of detectable light.For it to be visible to us, 1 quantum of light needs to be absorbed by 5- 14 retinal rods.
The JND(Just Noticeable Difference) can be measured using "Method of Constant Stimuli" or the "Staircase Procedure".
