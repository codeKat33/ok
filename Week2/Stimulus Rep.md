Any visual information is collected by the eyes then travels through the Ventral pathway and all the way through the dorsal pathway to the higher visual cortical areas.
A single neuron doesn't respond to the whole of any visible object but to a small localized area only which is also called Receptor field.
Receptive fields are estimated using STA or Spike Triggered Averaging method.In this, a visual stimuli are taken and then averaged in terms of spiketime.                             
Center and Surround of a Receptive field: Center is where the visual systems drive in the neuron to spike.In surround, spiking of a neuron isn't necessarily driven but can be modulated.
Orientation selectivity of cortical neurons was first discovered in cortical neurons. Data shows that highest neural activity is recorded when any visual stimulus is looked at vertically.
Such data is generally collected using Tuning Curves(fire rate as a function of the stimulus feature)
