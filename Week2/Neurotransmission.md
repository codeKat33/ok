Neurons fire 'Action Potential'. An action potential refers to the electrical signalling that occurs between the neurons.
Receptors are large proteins embedded in the plasma membrane. Neurotransmitter receptors are classified into two categories: Ionotropic or Ligand gated ion channel and the Metaprobic or G protein-coupled receptors.
All excitatory neurons are Glutamatergic and released by more than half of all the brain synapses.
Gamma aminobutyric acid or GABA is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. It binds to two post synaptic receptors, GABA(ionotropic) and GABA-B(metabotropic)
GABA is a signinficant mood modulator.When GABA function is impaired, neurons can become overexcited which can lead to restlessness, anxiety, irritability.
Dopamine can be considered a neuromodulator, it is released via volume transmission. A neuromodulator controls the amount of neurotransmitters synthesized and ultimately alters the strength of signal transmission between neurons.
 When the increase in neurotransmitters lasts for a long time(months to minutes), it is called Long-Term Potential or LTP.LTP is a cellular mechanism responsible for learning.
