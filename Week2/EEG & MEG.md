EEG stands for Electroencephalography.It is a graphical representation of difference in voltage between two cerebral locations plotted over time.
MEG stands for Magnetoencephalography. It deals with the measurement of magnetic fields due to neuronal activity at different locations over brain.
Artifacts: While performing EEG, one needs to be careful about Artifacts, which are signals that are not generated by the brain. These are of two types: Physiological and Non-Physiological.
Non-Physiological artifacts are caused due to electrical phenomenon or even devices(cell phones).Physiological artifacts may even be caused by the blink of an eye or muscle movements, squeezing of teeth etc.
While doing EEG and MEG, the brain signals are transformed into a function of frequency from a function of time using Fourier transformations.
 Pros of EEG & MEG: Non-invasive, portable and affordable, More tolerant to subject movement than fMRI.
 Cons: Limited spatial resolution, Artifact/Noise.
