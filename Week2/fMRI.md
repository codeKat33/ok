Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging a.k.a. fMRI measures the activity of neurons indirectly.
There are some types of experiments which are done using fMRI:          Block Designs: does a statistical comparision of the blood oxygen level dependent effects of the data images collected(Eyes opened v/s Eyes closed).So it basically serves comparision between different conditions.
Event Related Designs compare different stimuli. It first takes activities around each stimuli which are then compared statistically.
Resting State Designs: This involves no external stimuli. Functional connectitvity is measured during resting state.
