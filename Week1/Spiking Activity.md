While collecting various information into the 'Soma' , the dendrites are summing up various types of weighted potentials. When these potentials exceed a certain point, they trigger the Action Potential.
Action potentials are mainly rapid changes in the polarity of membrane potentials.
Spikes indicate action potentials fired by an individual person. They are fundamental to coding in brain.
There are certain properties of the neurons that help us understand what the spikes indicate, e.g, each neuron has a maximum firing frequency ,etc. All electrical properties of the neuron are subject to change.
Spiking activity is related to external stimuli. It can even tell about the health of a neuron. More importantly it tells about how plastic a neuron is, i.e, how it can change in response to any previous activity.
Connecting neurons into functional networks gives rise to a multitude of possibilities, how they'll be linked to one another.
Spikes have several drawbacks too: like, Recording technique requires skills up to that of an AI. Only single cell activity can be tracked.The amount of data generated can be very huge sometimes which becomes very difficult to sort.
